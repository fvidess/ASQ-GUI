## Strengths / Features
Our project has a very intuitive design and functionality. We made it as to it would re-render the page every time
there was a change so that the UI felt up to date at all times. We believe our CSS went above and beyond all 
expectations for the project. Any person could log into our GUI and would easily find their way around it.
